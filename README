know when the first version is released or if you want to participate to the 
development.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This plugin makes HTML tables more flexible :
	- Some columns can be resized (without changing the table width)
	- The content of some cell can be truncated if it's too long for
	  the cell width.
	
Usage :

$('selector').flextable({
	ellipsisClass: 'truncate',
	resizeableClass: 'resizeable',
	columnWidths: [20, 65, '50%', '100px'],
	ghostClass: 'ghost'
});
